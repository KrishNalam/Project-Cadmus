# chat
> Right now you're trying to do Calculus without knowing Algebra â€” Me

## The Setup
I will guide you through the process of building a chat application from scratch, giving all three of you different tasks - mostly in order to allow all of you to learn the same thing while not taking 1 year to build a basic app. I will also be learning with you, I **don't** know everything (I will be implementing video chat).

You will be responsible for:
- reading each other's code and understanding it
- writing good (clean) code
- completing tasks in a timely manner
-  **NOT** using AI

For each of your tasks:
1. Read the code that is already there
2. Write the code in a new branch named `person/<feature-name>`
3. Create a pull request (assign it to me)
4. Redo this process until the code is perfect and then push to main

I will be your Benevolent Dictator For Life (BDFL), but at a certain point **you will be able to choose** what you want to build - especially because you will want to learn certain things. At some point we will stop building this, it isn't an infinite project.

## Goals
- Setup an actual developer environment, using stock VSCode is useless, you might as well use Notepad
  - Using stock VSCode is like using a stock tank, you can run it, but you're probably going to lose every game you play
- Learn how to build *something* from **scratch** because you've never done it before
- Understand fundemental concepts and apply them abstractly (understand, the *why* of React)
- Learn to use Git(hub), HTML, CSS, JS, WebSockets, Node.js, SQLite, Express.js,  deployment platforms
- Learn about, SEO, security (encryption), API's
- You get green commit squares and PR's on your GitHub profile :)


## Rules
- Write clean commit messages follow [this](https://gist.github.com/joshbuchea/6f47e86d2510bce28f8e7f42ae84c716) and read [this guide to commit messages](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)
- Use the command line, do NOT use Github Desktop or any other GUI. Learn to use the integrated command line or Git Bash. - Note we need to go over bash and why it is important
- Only use branches, do not commit to main
- Setup styling, linters, and formatters - understand why we use Prettier, and the setup of ESLint
- Do not take shortcuts, this is the time to learn the right way to do things
- If you wrote it, you own it. That means any issues that arise from your code are your responsibility to fix. (exceptions will occur)

Carpe Diem.



## The Thought Process Behind this Project
(This is not relevant, but I'm writing it for myself)
The purpose of this project is really to level up all of our skills. Mridul knows Python, Java, but lacks any awareness of his development environment, and the ability to build something. Similiarly, Dave can code, I'm sure, but can he build a project in 48 hours that actually runs? Krish understands the basics of web development, but does he know why what is happening is happening? Or is he just guessing, based on what he's been told?

You might ask, isn't web development easy? Shouldn't we be doing big Quant projects in Python? Yea, if it's so easy, I give you 36 hours, go build, deploy and maintain an SPA with a backend. You can't? Then you don't know web development. The other thing with web development, is that it's a great place to learn. Sure you won't use JS in your final exams, or even HTML, CSS, but you will learn fundementals.

In my opinion, if you know the basics you will be able to transfer them anywhere. As an example, before my computer science exams, the only thing I do is brush up on the syntax of the language the exam is in, because I know and understand all the abilities of your average language. Similiarly, given any coding project, I know exactly how to tackle it, if it's a team project, I have a good development and collaboration environment.

At the end of the day, the question really is, why not? Why not build something. Really, if it's so easy, it will take you no time, but at the bare minimum you will learn.

P.S I don't give a crap about any of this, I just want an elite team to work with
