# chat
> Right now you're trying to do Calculus without knowing Algebra — Me

## The Setup
I will guide you through the process of building a chat application from scratch, giving all three of you different tasks - mostly in order to allow all of you to learn the same thing while not taking 1 year to build a basic app.

You will be responsible for:
- reading each other's code and understanding it
- writing good (clean) code
- completing tasks in a timely manner
-  **NOT** using AI

For each of your tasks:
1. Read the code that is already there
2. Write the code in a new branch named `person/<feature-name>`
3. Create a pull request (assign it to me)
4. Redo this process until the code is perfect and then push to main

I will be your Benevolent Dictator For Life (BDFL), but at a certain point **you will be able to choose** what you want to build - especially because you will want to learn certain things. At some point we will stop building this, it isn't an infinite project.

## Goals
- Setup a proper developer environment
  - Using stock VSCode is like trying to race a car with no modifications, it’ll get you from point A to point B, but you’re not going to win any races.
- Learn how to build *something* from **scratch**, experience matters.
- Learn fundamental concepts and apply them abstractly (e.g., understand why React works).
- Learn to about and how to use Git(hub), HTML, CSS, JS, WebSockets, Node.js, SQLite, Express.js, deployment tools, linters, formatters, SEO, security (encryption), API's and so on
- You get green commit squares and PR's on your GitHub profile :)

## Rules
- Write clean commit messages follow [this](https://gist.github.com/joshbuchea/6f47e86d2510bce28f8e7f42ae84c716) and read [this guide to commit messages](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)
- Use the command line, **avoid GUIs** like GitHub Desktop. Get comfortable with Git Bash and the integrated terminal.
- Only use branches, do not commit to main
- Set up and use linters, formatters, and styling tools like Prettier and ESLint.
- No shortcuts, this is the time to learn the proper way.
- If you wrote it, you own it. That means any issues that arise from your code are your responsibility to fix. (exceptions will occur)

Carpe Diem.



## The Thought Process Behind this Project
**(This is not relevant, but I'm writing it for myself)**

The goal of this project is to level up everyone's skills. Mridul knows Python and Java but lacks awareness of his dev environment and how to build something real. Dave can code, but can he actually build and deploy a working project in 48 hours? Krish knows basic web dev, but does he understand _why_ things work the way they do, or is he just following instructions?

Some might ask: isn't web dev easy? Shouldn't we focus on big Python projects? Well, if it's so easy, I challenge you to build, deploy, and maintain an SPA with a backend in 36 hours. If you can't, you don't fully understand web development. And while you may not use JS or HTML in exams, web dev teaches you valuable fundamentals.

Knowing the basics allows you to transfer skills to anywhere.

At the end of the day, why not build something? If it's easy, it'll take no time, and at the very least, you'll learn.

P.S. I don't care about any of this—I just want an elite team to work with.

— Note: we need to go over bash and why it is important
