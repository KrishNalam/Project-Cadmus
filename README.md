# chat

## The Setup
I will guide you through the process of building a chat application from scratch, giving all three of you different tasks - mostly in order to allow all of you to learn the same thing while not taking 1 year to build a basic app. I will also be learning with you, I **don't** know everything (I will be implementing video chat).

You will be responsible for:
- reading each other's code and understanding it
- writing good (clean) code
- completing tasks in a timely manner
-  **NOT** using AI

For each of your tasks:
1. Read the code that is already there
2. Write the code in a new branch named `feature/<task-name>`
3. Create a pull request (assign it to me)
4. Redo this process until the code is perfect and then push to main

I will be your Benevolent Dictator For Life (BDFL), but at a certain point **you will be able to choose** what you want to build - especially because you will want to learn certain things. At some point we will stop building this, it isn't an infinite project.

## Goals:
- Learn how to build *something* from **scratch** because you've never done it before
- Understand fundemental concepts and apply them abstractly (understand, the *why* of React)
- Learn to use Git(hub), HTML, CSS, JS, WebSockets, Node.js, SQLite, Express.js,  deployment platforms
- Learn about, SEO, security (encryption), API's
- You get green commit squares and PR's on your GitHub profile :)
